        "\n",
        "1. Just like last time, provide plots for training error, test error, and test accuracy. Also provide a plot of your train and test perplexity per epoch.\n",
        "    - In class we defined perplexity as `2^(p*log_2(q))`, However the PyTorch cross entropy function uses the natural log. To compute perplexity directly from the cross entropy, you should use `e^p*ln(q)`.\n",
        "    - We encourage you to try multiple network modifications and hyperparameters, but you only need to provide plots for your best model. Please list the modifications and hyperparameters.    \n",
        "    \n",
        "2. What was your final test accuracy? What was your final test perplexity?\n",
        "3. What was your favorite sentence generated via each of the sampling methods? What was the prompt you gave to generate that sentence?\n",
        "4. Which sampling method seemed to generate the best results? Why do you think that is?\n",
        "5. For sampling and beam search, try multiple temperatures between 0 and 2. \n",
        "    - Which produces the best outputs? Best as in made the most sense, your favorite, or funniest, doesn't really matter how you decide.\n",
        "    - What does a temperature of 0 do? What does a temperature of 0<temp<1 do? What does a temperature of 1 do? What does a temperature of above 1 do? What would a negative temperature do (assuming the code allowed for negative temperature)?\n",
        "    \n",
        "Questions for each of the \"Other things\" sections. Only answer the questions corresponding to the ones you chose.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. New Corpus\n",
        "    1. What corpus did you choose? How many characters were in it?\n",
        "    2. What differences did you notice between the sentences generated with the new/vs old corpus.\n",
        "    3. Provide outputs for each sampling method on the new corpus (you can pick one temperature, but say what it was).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. New Architecture\n",
        "    1. What was your design? What did you try that didn't work well?\n",
        "    2. What was your lowest test perplexity? Provide training and testing plots.\n",
        "    3. Provide outputs for each sampling method on the new corpus (you can pick one temperature, but say what it was).\n",

        "1. LSTM\n",
        "    1. What new difficulties did you run into while training?\n",
        "    2. Were results better than the GRU? Provide training and testing plots.\n",

Temperature of 0 < temp < 1 are between these two conditions. The results make sense and are diverse. Temperature of 2 makes more randomness. This brings more creativity to the results.

The training process is too slow, so I didn't get an best combination of hyperparameters. I tried with sequence length = 40, batch size = 128, feature size = 2048 and got an accuracy of 60%"
